A Python implementation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and data visualization.

## Overview
PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is a dimensionality reduction technique used in data analysis and machine learning. It helps you to reduce the number of features in a dataset while keeping the most important information. It changes your original features into new features these new features donâ€™t overlap with each other and the first few keep most of the important differences found in the original data.

PCA is commonly used for data preprocessing for use with machine learning algorithms. It helps to remove redundancy, improve computational efficiency and make data easier to visualize and analyze especially when dealing with high-dimensional data.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique for reducing the dimensionality of datasets while preserving as much variance as possible. This implementation demonstrates:
- Data standardization
- Covariance matrix computation
- Eigenvalue decomposition
- Projection to principal components
- Variance explained analysis

## Installation
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn pandas
